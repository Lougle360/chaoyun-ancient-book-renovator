name: chaoyun-reader-experience-reviser
description: Read a complete modernized book as an ordinary reader, diagnose whole-book comprehension failures, and apply traceable additions, removals from the reading path, rewrites, and reorganizations. Use after the first reading edition and again when a publication candidate needs reader-experience proofing; do not repair OCR or silently change source meaning.

# 超云全书读者审编

Read the book from cover to glossary as the declared reader, not as the pipeline that produced it. Separate the first audit pass from the revision pass so that editing does not hide the original reader problem.

## Modes

- **Manuscript mode:** required after `$chaoyun-reading-editor`. Review `50-edited/modern-reading.md`, apply accepted changes, and produce the reader-accepted manuscript before final uncertainty adjudication.
- **Proof mode:** run on the publication candidate when pagination, figure placement, navigation, or rendered context may change the reading experience. Return content defects to manuscript mode and visual defects to `$chaoyun-quality-publisher`.

## Workflow

1. Freeze the input hash and complete an uninterrupted reader pass before editing. Review introduction promises, prerequisites, navigation, continuity, terminology burden, examples, figures, repetition, source/editor distinction, and closure.
2. Record every obstacle in `50-edited/reader-review.json`. A statement such as “reads well” is not evidence; identify where the reader stops, guesses, backtracks, or loses the argument.
3. Create append-only `50-edited/reader-revision-ledger.jsonl` records using exactly one operation:
   - `add`: supply evidence-based context, explanation, example, transition, route, or caution.
   - `delete_from_reading_path`: remove repetition or pipeline clutter from continuous reading while preserving source material and a destination or provenance reference.
   - `rewrite`: clarify archaic syntax, vague reference, overloaded sentences, or terminology without changing accepted meaning.
   - `reorganize`: improve sequence, hierarchy, cross-reference, or figure placement while retaining a recoverable source order.
4. Route OCR, missing-source, translation, attribution, or meaning uncertainty back to the responsible Skill and create an uncertainty candidate. Do not solve an evidence problem through fluent editing.
5. Apply accepted revisions to the reading layer, update `reader-aids.json` when the introduction or glossary changes, and preserve contributing `block_id` values.
6. Perform a fresh regression read of the revised full manuscript. Write `50-edited/reader-acceptance-report.json` only from the actual review and revision ledger.
7. Run `scripts/validate_reader_revision.py <workspace>`. Publication remains blocked until it passes.

Read [references/reader-revision-contract.md](references/reader-revision-contract.md) before creating review or revision records.

## Boundaries

- Do not edit `20-source`, repair unreadable glyphs, or turn an uncertain translation into a confident sentence.
- Do not delete source-bearing material merely because it is difficult. Move it to a labeled reference path when continuous reading benefits, and keep provenance.
- Do not add generic background, decorative examples, or praise that answers no reader problem.
- Do not let the same pass both create and certify its own revision. The final regression reviewer differs from the revision producer.

## Gate

Pass when all required reading dimensions have evidence-based verdicts, every applied change has provenance and before/after state where applicable, no blocking reader issue remains, the acceptance hash matches the final manuscript, and medium/high semantic-risk changes are linked to the unified uncertainty lifecycle.
