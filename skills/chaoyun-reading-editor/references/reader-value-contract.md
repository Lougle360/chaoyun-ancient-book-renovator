# Reader value contract

Use this contract for an ordinary-reader edition. Its purpose is not to prove that front matter exists, but to prove that a non-specialist can understand why the book matters and continue reading without being abandoned at specialist vocabulary.

## Editorial stance: 增、删、改、整

- **增**：add only the context, definitions, examples, transitions, reading routes, and cautions that remove a real reader obstacle. Label editor-created material and attach evidence.
- **删**：remove repetition, pipeline language, and reader-hostile clutter from the continuous reading path. Never erase source content; move retained catalogues or technical material to a labeled reference section with provenance.
- **改**：rewrite archaic syntax, vague references, overlong sentences, and unexplained jumps into natural modern Chinese without increasing certainty or changing the accepted meaning.
- **整**：organize chapters, concepts, figures, cross-references, and terminology around the reader's questions while preserving a separately recoverable source order.

Every operation answers a documented reader problem. Cosmetic rewriting alone is not a reader-value pass.

## Required structured file

Create `50-edited/reader-aids.json`. The summary counts in `editorial-report.json` are derived from this file, never typed independently.

## Introduction acceptance

All nine introduction sections are required. They may be combined in the rendered prose, but each must have substantive book-specific content in the structured record. Generic praise, a list of headings, or a production disclaimer does not satisfy the section.

Source-derived claims use block or physical-page evidence. External historical background, when included, names its editorial source. When evidence is unavailable, say so in `limitations_and_cautions`; do not fill the gap with a confident generalization.

The introduction must let the target reader answer: What is this book? What does it contain? How are its parts related? Why might I read it? What background do I need? Where should I start? What should I not treat as established modern fact? What did this edition change?

## Glossary acceptance

- Build an inventory from the actual book. Every term in `40-modernized/terminology.json` is either an entry or an explicitly excluded item with a reason.
- Every entry has an exact source occurrence linked to an existing block. A summary count is not evidence.
- `plain_definition` explains the term without merely repeating it or replacing it with another unexplained specialist term.
- `contextual_definition` explains how this book uses the term; a generic dictionary definition is insufficient.
- Core terms additionally require a usage example, related terms, and a likely confusion. Supporting terms may omit these only when the plain and contextual definitions are independently sufficient. Opaque terms use `tier: opaque`, state the uncertainty, and must not receive an invented definition.
- A single-character match, contents-page mention, or substring collision is not automatically the first substantive occurrence. Verify it against the linked block.
- In the rendered book, explain a term at first reader-facing use as well as in the end glossary.

After this file validates, `$chaoyun-reader-experience-reviser` performs the independent whole-book reading pass, glossary sampling, revision loop, and final reader acceptance. Production evidence and acceptance evidence remain separate.
