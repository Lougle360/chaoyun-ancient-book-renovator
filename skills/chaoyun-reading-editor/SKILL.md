# 超云今读编辑

Transform an accurate modern rendering into a book that contemporary readers can follow.

The reader, not the pipeline, is the organizing point of view. Every editorial action follows `增、删、改、整`: add what removes a real comprehension barrier, remove reader-hostile clutter from the continuous path without erasing source evidence, rewrite for natural modern understanding without changing meaning, and reorganize navigation while preserving recoverable source order.

## Establish the edition

Record target reader, reading goal, reading level, modernization depth, annotation density, and whether the output is reading-only or source-comparison. If the user asks for ordinary people to read directly, optimize for interested non-specialists: retain necessary domain terminology, explain it on first occurrence, and do not assume prior training.

## Editing work

1. Preserve every source `block_id` in `50-edited/blocks.jsonl` while allowing display-level paragraph grouping with contributing IDs.
2. Build coherent book, volume, chapter, section, note, figure, and table hierarchy.
3. Improve sentence length, transitions, and paragraphing only within the accepted meaning.
4. Add a front-of-book reading map when the original structure is unfamiliar, and give each major chapter a concise introduction stating its question, key concepts, and reading route.
5. Create reader aids—first-use term notes, historical context, cross-references, examples, and practical observation checklists where appropriate—as explicitly labeled editorial content.
6. Keep figures and captions near the relevant passage. Maintain stable numbering and alt text, and explain what to inspect and in what order when the image is necessary to understand the text.
7. Attribute traditional causal, predictive, medical, or fortune claims as source/traditional views. Separate them from observable descriptions without deleting or endorsing them.
8. Move repetitive catalogues or case lists to clearly named reference sections only when this improves continuous reading; preserve source order and provenance.
9. Treat the book introduction as a substantive reader deliverable. Explain the surviving work, intended reader, reader value, contents and relationships, distinctive features, textual context, reading routes, limitations, and what this edition changed. A production note or generic praise is not an introduction.
10. Build a term inventory from this book, then write tiered glossary entries. Core terms require a plain definition, contextual definition, exact first source occurrence, usage example, related concepts, and common-confusion guidance. Do not publish one-line labels that send the reader back to the unexplained text.
11. Generate `50-edited/reader-aids.json`, then render `50-edited/modern-reading.md`. Derive `editorial-report.json` counts from the structured reader aids; never type success counts independently.
12. Run a separate reader review with a reviewer identity different from the producer. The reviewer must be able to answer what the book is, who it is for, how its parts relate, why to read it, where to start, what its limits are, and what the edition changed.

Use [references/editorial-policy.md](references/editorial-policy.md) for boundaries and labeling.
For ordinary-reader work, read and enforce [references/reader-value-contract.md](references/reader-value-contract.md), then run:

```shell
python scripts/validate_reader_value.py book-workspace
```

## Gate

Pass when the declared target reader can follow the book without specialist prerequisites, the introduction answers the required reader questions, every glossary entry has verifiable book-specific evidence, the independent reader review passes, hierarchy and references are coherent, all content IDs are accounted for, and editorial additions are visibly distinct from translated source content. OCR corruption or missing evidence returns to reconstruction. Fluency never overrides semantic fidelity.
