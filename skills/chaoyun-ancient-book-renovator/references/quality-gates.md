# Quality gates

## G0 Intake integrity

- Source opens and its SHA-256, byte size, page count, and filename are recorded.
- Encryption, corruption, missing pages, duplicates, and excluded pages are accounted for.
- Included, excluded, blank/noncontent, and unreadable page counts reconcile exactly to the physical PDF page count.
- `delivery_mode` is explicit. Source identity and `source_pdf_pages` are verified against the actual intake PDF, not a report total. Every physical page has at least one block record, including a reasoned placeholder for blank, excluded or unreadable pages.
- The source is never overwritten.

## G1 Diagnosis

- Every page has a route and layout/language classification.
- Every distinct page family has a representative verification sample.
- Known unsupported content is recorded before bulk processing.

## G2 Faithful source

- Every logical page and content block is accounted for.
- Reading order, headings, notes, images, captions, and tables are checked against page images.
- OCR uncertainties remain visible; fluent inference is not accepted as transcription evidence.
- Raw uncertainty candidates have stable IDs and preserve source-image evidence; they are not yet treated as reader-facing defects.

## G2.5 Uncertainty adjudication

- Every raw candidate belongs to exactly one active adjudication; repeated reports may be grouped without deleting their IDs.
- A revised adjudication supersedes an inactive historical decision; every candidate has exactly one active decision and open issue IDs remain stable.
- Each decision is classified as confirmed, noncontent, structural, duplicate, or materially open, with explicit reader impact.
- Confirmed source corrections include before/after text and evidence. Meaning alone is not sufficient to repair a glyph.
- The reader-facing ledger is regenerated from `open_material` decisions only and contains no resolved stamp, variant, cross-page, semantic-comment, or duplicate record.
- Candidate count, adjudicated count, and material-open count are reported separately.
- Active closure requires located file evidence, checked/not-applicable decisions across six impact scopes, an independently executed bound review, and replayable applied changes where corrected. A duplicate must resolve to a closed canonical candidate. Evidence failure blocks the gate even when the projected open count is zero.
- A representative real chapter trial precedes scale-up; final publication independently rechecks every active decision against the frozen manuscript. Both artifacts are checked by `project_open_items.py --check --publication`; self-tests cannot count as an actual trial.

## G3 Normalization

- Each changed character, punctuation insertion, merge, or split is traceable.
- Script conversion and variant normalization do not change claims or translate the prose.
- Names, dates, measurements, quotations, and technical terms receive stricter review.

## G4 Modernization

For ordinary-reader work, first pass workflow 1.8 `book_understood`, `reader_designed` and `sample_accepted` under [reader-production.md](reader-production.md). The understanding brief explains the whole source; the design places prerequisites/examples; a separate actual sample reader tests the method. Only sample translation is permitted before these prerequisites. Their validator checks bindings and task evidence, never grants semantic acceptance. Existing 1.6 uncertainty trial requirements remain in force and use the same chapter where possible.

- Every source content block has a modernized record or an explicit disposition.
- A translated/retained record requires nonempty stage text. Stage ID equality alone cannot certify transcription or translation completion.
- Classical Chinese, modern Japanese, classical Japanese, and kanbun use the correct route.
- The modern text adds no unsupported fact, causal claim, or certainty.
- High-risk blocks receive an independent comparison or enter the uncertainty ledger.

## G5 Reading edit

- Editorial additions are labeled and are not mixed into translated source text.
- Chapter hierarchy, terminology, cross-references, figures, and notes remain coherent.
- Readability improvements preserve the accepted meaning.
- For an ordinary-reader edition, the book includes a reading route, chapter guidance, first-use term explanations, figure-reading guidance, and a complete glossary where applicable.
- Traditional causal or predictive claims are attributed as historical/source claims and remain distinct from directly observable descriptions.
- OCR corruption, missing text, and uncertain reading order are returned to reconstruction rather than polished into fluent prose.
- `editorial-report.json` records the evidence used for the book-nature statement, source contents reconstruction, contextual glossary, content-figure guidance, and semantic status.
- `reader-aids.json` supplies item-level introduction and glossary evidence. The whole-book reader revision ledger and acceptance report pass independently, and all derived counts match `editorial-report.json`.
- Printed page numbers are not mapped to physical PDF pages by offset assumption; the mapping is verified against page images or explicit page records.
- Reader text contains no model verdicts, candidate fields, repair-queue text, pipeline states, or internal validation messages.

## G5.5 Whole-book reader revision

Workflow 1.8 requires reader review/acceptance 1.2: meaningful contiguous units, actual task/answer/assessment files and provenance, with task links from each unit and core glossary sample. It additionally binds an immutable process-edition snapshot and the six final-reader-cut checks. Repeated generic answers are not section-specific evidence. Old acceptance cannot be upgraded by altering a schema field. Full coverage is preserved without requiring a fake comprehension report for each small heading. The 1.1 mechanics below remain applicable except for the upgraded acceptance version and reading-unit boundaries.

- `$chaoyun-reader-experience-reviser` reads the complete manuscript before editing, records reader obstacles across all nine dimensions, and applies traceable `add`, `delete_from_reading_path`, `rewrite`, or `reorganize` operations.
- Deletion from the reading path preserves source material and provenance. Medium/high semantic-risk revisions enter the unified uncertainty lifecycle.
- A fresh regression reviewer differs from the revision producer. The acceptance hash matches the final manuscript, no proposed or returned revision remains unresolved, and glossary sampling passes.
- Reader schema 1.1 requires real input/output snapshots and replayable edits, evidenced closure across every cycle, complete section-level comprehension records, all core terms rechecked, and separate production/review execution records. See the reader-revision contract; strings naming different reviewers alone do not prove independent review.

## G6 Publication

- Markdown image references resolve and no source-absolute paths leak into the package.
- Both reading edition and source-comparison edition are generated when source evidence permits.
- PDF fonts embed correctly; headings, TOC, page breaks, images, and Chinese/Japanese glyphs render.
- The quality report lists coverage, grade, models/tools, cost, unresolved items, and limitations.
- The declared release path is checked for locks before generation. A temporary PDF is validated before atomic replacement; a lock may block replacement but must not create a second ambiguous official release.
- Grade A requires zero active material items. Grade B rejects every active high-impact item. The quality report's candidate, adjudication, active-decision, and open counts must match the ledgers.
- For ordinary-reader editions, `editorial-report.json` must pass its contract and its high-impact count must match the adjudication ledger. Structural and visual success cannot upgrade a semantically blocked edition.
- The release includes the declared cover, copyright/credits page, author/editor/producer credits, clickable TOC, and PDF bookmarks.
- `release_filename` exists, matches the declared book title and edition label, and is the single unambiguous official PDF.
- Link targets and local assets are validated programmatically. Every ordinary-reader PDF page is inspected regardless of book length; other delivery modes declare their inspection scope.
- Candidate promotion runs both gates before replacing the official PDF. Book-specific outcomes and source-to-reader fidelity evidence are required; see [delivery-and-rework.md](delivery-and-rework.md).
- For ordinary-reader editions, the release manifest binds manuscript, publication Markdown, assets, PDF and page images; source fidelity and actual reader comprehension still require substantive review.

## Grade rule

Grade A requires all gates passed and no material unresolved item. Grade B allows bounded low/medium ledger items that do not undermine ordinary reading and permits no high-impact open item. Grade C covers drafts with material ambiguity, any active high-impact item, or an incomplete semantic/editorial contract. Grade D means the source cannot responsibly support the requested result.
